        <h2>All About Typography</h2>
        <p class="headline">
            Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the
            reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important
            information in a web page. You can use
            <span>text-transform: uppercase;</span> to make a whole body of text
            uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which you should do sparingly) - it's time
            to chat more about other components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
            headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is intentional! Serif font faces are generally
            considered pretty inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more difficult to
            visually differentiate the characters from one another. At large font sizes, such as those seen in most
            headings, serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where serif
            characters start and where they end.
        </p>
        <p>
            But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might see in
            web pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so it
            stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            "This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh?
            A great lesson in User Experience Design, where we take special care to implement our web page in a way that
            makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers. Differentiating our different typography components
            visually makes information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."

        <hr>
        <h3>a new section</h3>
        <p>
            And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a hr element (a 'horizontal rule' or a
            divider) and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun?
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice as well that when we entered in the H3 content, it was all lowercase, but now it's in a nice Title
            Case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using text-transform:
            capitalize; we can implement title cased content.
        </p>

        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <p>These are sub-subsections, providing another level of organization below h3. They are typically rendered
            smaller than h3.
        </p>

        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <p>These represent even deeper levels of subsections. They are usually rendered smaller than h4.
        </p>

        <h5>Heading 6</h5>
        <p>This is the least important heading tag and represents the deepest level of sectioning. It's often rendered
            in a relatively small font, similar to regular body text but often bold.
