My hands on HTML and CSS projects as I learn and grow


# Project-1 : Artist Portfolio
SN Ceramics Portfolio
This project is a portfolio website for Shobhit Nautiyal, showcasing ceramic work. The site features a navigation bar, a gallery of ceramic pieces with images and titles, and an about section with contact information.

The project was built focusing on foundational web development concepts, specifically utilizing HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with a focus on the Box Model, padding, and margins to control layout and spacing.

# Project-2 : Mini Blog Post Project
This project is a small, static blog post built using HTML and CSS. It focuses on showcasing fundamental web development skills, including semantic HTML structure and CSS styling for typography and layout.

**Key Features:**

* **Semantic HTML:** The content is structured using appropriate HTML5 semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<article>`, `<p>`, `<blockquote>`, `<footer>`) for better organization and accessibility.
* **CSS Styling:** The project demonstrates the use of CSS to style the blog post, including:
    * Custom font families for headings and body text.
    * Various typography properties like `font-size`, `line-height`, `text-transform`, and `font-weight`.
    * Basic layout using margins and padding.
    * Styling for specific elements like blockquotes and the footer navigation.
* **Typography Exploration:** The project serves as a practical example of how different CSS units (`px`, `em`, `rem`) can be used for font sizing.

**Potential Future Enhancements:**

* Responsiveness for different screen sizes (tablets, mobiles).
* Improved accessibility features (ARIA roles, color contrast checks).
* More advanced layout techniques (Flexbox or Grid).
* Use of CSS variables for better maintainability.

This project provides a foundational understanding of creating a simple web page with styled content.
