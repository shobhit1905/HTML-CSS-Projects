SN Ceramics Portfolio
This project is a portfolio website for Shobhit Nautiyal, showcasing ceramic work. The site features a navigation bar, a gallery of ceramic pieces with images and titles, and an about section with contact information.

The project was built focusing on foundational web development concepts, specifically utilizing HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with a focus on the Box Model, padding, and margins to control layout and spacing.
